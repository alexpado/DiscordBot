## DiscordBot Library
![Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/alexpado/DiscordBot/workflows/Java%20CI%20with%20Gradle/badge.svg)


***Note** This is sill in beta but should be pretty stable. If you have any problem or suggestion, please feel free
 to open an issue.*
 
This project exists mainly because I was tired to copy paste my "command manager" over and over across all projects.
By doing this library, I enhanced my command system with a kind of command templating system allowing fast command
creation.

### How to use ?
